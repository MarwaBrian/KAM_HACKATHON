## Data Understanding
The data contains a collection of 3 datasets, 2 for imports and 1 for exports.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Modeling
We developed a predictive model to estimate the taxes on imported goods. By analyzing past import data—like the type of goods, their value, and origin countries—our model learns patterns to predict future taxes. We used a machine learning approach called "Random Forest Regressor" to make these predictions.

The model helps businesses and policymakers estimate tax obligations on future imports, aiding in budgeting and financial planning. It considers various factors like the goods' type and origin to provide accurate tax predictions, making it a practical tool for reducing uncertainty and improving financial planning.

### Next Steps

Next steps for enhancing the tax prediction model include exploring more advanced machine learning techniques to improve accuracy and reliability. Incorporating additional features such as currency exchange rates, seasonal trends, or product-specific data could refine the model's predictions. Additionally, testing deep learning models, such as neural networks, and utilizing ensemble methods may provide further performance gains. Continued hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation will also be essential to ensure the model generalizes well across different datasets. Expanding the dataset with more diverse samples will help improve the model's robustness and adaptability.


## Conclusion


The predictive model developed for tax prediction showed promising results with a test accuracy of approximately 85%. This performance indicates the model's ability to estimate import taxes based on various features like product value, origin, and tax history. The model effectively captures complex relationships in the data, demonstrating its potential utility in assisting with tax prediction tasks.

However, further refinement is possible. Enhancing the model through additional hyperparameter tuning, incorporating more relevant features, and expanding the dataset could improve accuracy and generalization. Exploring advanced machine learning techniques, such as ensemble methods, could also contribute to achieving better predictive.
